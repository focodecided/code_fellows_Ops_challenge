Ops Challenge - Automated Endpoint Configuration
# Overview
Standing up Windows 10 endpoints from scratch can be extremely time-consuming. You will want to automate Windows system configurations as much as possible, to save yourself precious time. In class, we can simply export an OVA of a Windows 10 VM; however, in a production operations environment, you may not have such luxuries. It is good to get a sense of how PowerShell can contribute to this effort.

## Scenario
Your team wants to automate the system's configuration of new Windows 10 deployments.

Objectives: Write a PowerShell script that automates the configuration of a new Windows 10 endpoint. Your script should perform the following:
Enable File and Printer Sharing
Allow ICMP traffic
Enable Remote management
Remove bloatware
Enable Hyper-V
Disable SMBv1, an insecure protocol
Test and validate that your script achieves the desired outcome for each listed objective. Put screenshots and discussion of your testing into a Google Doc and submit the link alongside your Github link.


### Did your script enable File and Printer Sharing?
We ran the code.
What did you do to test before/after?
File and printer sharing was on

### Did your script allow ICMP traffic?
 Nothing Changed because the Firewall rule already exists.
What did you do to test before/after?

### Did your script enable Remote management?
The command stated, “The operation completed successfully
What did you do to test before/after?

### Did your script remove bloatware?
