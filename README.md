# code_fellows_Ops_challenge

### 1. What is this repo all about?

This repository is a foundational repo that encompasses my post-class challenges for Ops 201 course for Code Fellows. After each class, I am able to challenge myself. I get to collaborate with my fellow classmates to arrive at script or automation that answer the challenge requirements. 

### 2. Why are you learning these skill?
On the path towards being a Cypersecurity professional, having basic knowledge of the scripting and automation in different operating systems such as Linux and Windows, and programs such as Powershell and Visual Studio are crucial. The goal being to be prepared to join the teams ensuring the protection of cyber asset for small and large agencies, and have the necessary tools for a growing and changing cybersecurity landscape. 

### 3. What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
Some concepts learned in Ops 201 are:
- Backups via Windows and Veeams and other external devices. 
- RDP and SSH - ability to remote into another device via multiple methods
- Fundamentals of AWS Lighstall and EC2 to quickly create and build new terminals and operating systems via Amazon AWS servers

### 4. What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
My favorite Ops challenge was when we were able to RDP into an Ubuntu lab computer to set up Virtual Machines. I was able to install different ova files with different simulated issues that needed to be solved. 

### 5. How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace? 
Learning shell scripting as we go through numerous virtualizaton makes it easier to grab shell scripting concepts useful in the workplace. Especially in situations where it may be unable or slower to access the GUI to get the job done.

### 6. What scripts would you like to improve if you had the time? 
I definitely did not have enough time learn Powershell scripting as I would have liked. So that's an area I may like to focus some more time to learn how to script commands that can automate numerous Windows requirements. 

### 7. What aspects of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next? 
Currently, I am still at the foundational stages of all shell scripting skillset. But with additional practice I am confident I can improve in them.

# Happy days better days
